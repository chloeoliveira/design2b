  <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
    <p>Cinnamon in my teeth<p>
    <p>From your kiss</p>
    <p>You're touching me</p>
    <p>All the pills that you did</p>
    <p>Violet, blue, green, red to keep me</p>
    <p>At arm's length don't work</p>
    <p>You try to push me out</p>
    <p>But I just find my way back in</p>
    <p>Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out</p>
    <p>I win</p>

  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>There's things I wanna say to you</p> 
    <p>But I'll just let you live</p>
    <p>Like if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p>You'll be the first who ever did</p>
    <p>There's things I wanna talk about</p>
    <p>But better not to give</p>
    <p>But if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p>You'll be the first who ever did</p>

  <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
    <p>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</p>
    <p>Hold me, love me, touch me, honey</p>
    <p>Be the first who ever did</p>
    <p>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
    <p>Hold me, love me, touch me, honey</p>
    <p>Be the first who ever did</p>

  <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
    <p>Kerosene in my hands</p>
    <p>You make me mad, I'm fire again</p>
    <p>All the pills that you take</p>
    <p>Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work</p>

  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave</p>
    <p>Like if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p>You'll be the first who ever did</p>
    <p>There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep</p>
    <p>But if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p>You'll be the first who ever did</p>

  <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
    <p>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</p>
    <p>Hold me, love me, touch me, honey</p>
    <p>Be the first who ever did</p>
    <p>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</p>
    <p>Hold me, love me, touch me, honey</p>
    <p>Be the first who ever did</p>

  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave</p>
    <p>Like if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p>You'll be the first who ever did</p>
    <p>There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep</p>
    <p>Like if you hold me without hurting me</p>
    <p> You'll be the first who ever did</p>
