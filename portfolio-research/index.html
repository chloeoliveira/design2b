            <p>Visually Interesting uses color, font, and images to capture attention and also keep it interesting with its interesting compositions Visually intriguing but also simple to follow and understand </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://lukeandnik.co.uk/">Luke and Nik Design</a></li>
            <p>Uses motion which is really cool! It is interactive to a certain degree; when you move mouse around you can remove shapes off the screen that appear. It is simple, direct, and uses lots of image rather than text</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mainstudio.com/">Main Studio Design</a></li>
            <p>It is simple, straightforward, and its grid-like type of layout is successful in showcasing work</p>
        </ul>

            <li><a href="https://oldsite.sallythurer.com/">Sally Thurer Design</a></li>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.travisscott.com/utopia-world/">Travis Scott Design</a></li>
            <p>Super visually interesting, sticks to an aesthetic consistently, and there is lots of imagery and videos rather than text but it is still successful in being visually intriguing</p>
        </ul>

        <h1>Portfolio's I Don't Like:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sammorr.is/">Sam Morris Design</a></li>
            <p>The lines behind the images are distracting and there is a limited palette</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://nathansingh.co.uk/">Nathan Singh Design</a></li>
            <p>Only showing image and description may make the user not interact with the website for more than a few minutes, lots of words that are tiny, and there is no color and play with typography</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://symphonyinacid.net/">Symphony In Acid Design</a></li>
            <p>Not very visually interesting, limited palette, and a little confusing to navigate</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://esmeebruins.com/">Esm√©e Bruins Design</a></li>
            <p>Overwhelming, has lots of words can be intimidating and turn away users, uses a grid which i think is unnecessary, and don't like the aesthetic of the portfolio</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://ilariagolin.com/">Ilaria Golin Design</a></li>
            <p>Not my style and the composition is weird to me</p>
        </ul>
